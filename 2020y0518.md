Thoughts on a new project
=========================

Background
----------
Some ideas on the project of data viewing web application.


Code Requirement
----------------

1. maximum depth is three(3)
2. the separation of mechanism and policy
3. decouple from other components

*Explanation*

All file path, class hierarchy MUST have maximum depth of three(3).

All the main loop, dispatch logic MUST NOT make any decisions but delegate to the instances which they dispatch to.
If no destination is available for dispatching, fall-back to predefined default value, which SHOULD be easily detected by the caller.

All the dependencies to other components MUST be localized. (Be orthogonal.)


Functional Requirement
----------------------

+ user may create arbitrary combinations of __markers__ for filtering
+ user should be able to specify some attributes of the __marker__
+ user may want different display styles
+ user can only view the data that the permission grants


How to Deal With the Challenge
------------------------------

User makes decisions, not your code: put checks on the user's input, but stand out of the user's way.

Keep the interface stable and clean: only add new interface when it is absolutely needed.

Give user freedom to customize: add a function to update user's own CSS sheet (with limited feature, for simplicity and security).

Re-use existing implementation, but not over-use: refactor them if needed.
